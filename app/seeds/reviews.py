    review="The Neanthe Bella Palm has its ups and downs. On one hand, it's a top air purification plant and adds a lush green touch to your decor. It's widely used in interior design settings. However, I found it a bit challenging to care for. Despite being touted as easy to care for, it required more attention than I expected. The preference for bright indirect lighting made it a bit tricky to find the perfect spot for it. Additionally, I struggled to find the right balance with watering. Overwatering led to yellow fronds, and underwatering made the plant look dry. While it has its benefits, it didn't quite meet my expectations. 2 stars.",

    review="The Coffee Plant is a lovely addition to any indoor space. Its pale green leaves create a soothing atmosphere, and the fragrance during blooming adds a delightful touch. I appreciate that it helps purify the indoor air and brings positive energy to the house.The care instructions provided were helpful. Placing it in a well-lit area without direct sunlight and watering moderately when the topsoil dries have worked well for me. The high humidity requirement and regular misting have been manageable, except during the blooming period.The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the fertilizing frequency feels a bit high. Once every 2 weeks from spring to fall seems a bit demanding. However, overall, I'm pleased with this Coffee Plant and its contribution to my indoor space.",
